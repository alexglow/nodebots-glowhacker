# nodebots-glowhacker

From NodeBots SF workshop, "glowhacker" LED bike lights! See tutorial at http://hackster.io/glowascii/nodebots-glowhacker (coming soon...)

Here are a couple of example sketches and circuit diagrams!

_SKETCHES FOR LIGHTBLUE BEAN_  
**glow-bean-1color** • Blink one color on and off!!! Use with circuit diagrams 1 & 2.  
**glow-bean-GYR** • Blink your LED strip green, yellow, red, off. Use with the color-switching circuit diagram.  

_DIAGRAMS_  
**June-Workshop-Diagram.jpg** • The original diagram! Sketched with my finger on an iPad... be gentle  
**1-simple-smart-lights.jpg** • Pretty much the same circuit, taken down to its simplest form.  
**2-direct-vs-smart-power.jpg** • The same thing, with a switch to power the lights directly, in case the microcontroller is removed or out of power.  
**3-color-switching-and-multi-strips.jpg** • Want to switch between two different colors? Use two transistors, one for each. You can also connect two color rails together to get a combination color (purple, yellow, teal). This diagram also shows how to hook up two LED strips.
